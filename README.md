# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This project features a responsive and visually attractive layout, including sections like Projects, Skills, About Me, and Contact Information. Utilizing CSS for styling, I've ensured cross-browser compatibility and a user-friendly experience. 

I've focused on clear navigation, cohesive typography, and a harmonious color scheme to create a compelling and professional representation of my skills and achievements in web development. This project not only refines my technical abilities but also showcases my dedication to creating polished and engaging web applications.
